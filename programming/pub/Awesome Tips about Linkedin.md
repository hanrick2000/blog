### The problem: Upgrade to Premium to continue searching
Sometimes when we are looking for new opportunities, we may use Linkedin a lot in a short time. You may reach its limit for free user, and ask us to upgrade to Premium to continue searching.

- Use Google search
  - site:linkedin.com/in engineer manager at the_company

#### People Also Viewed
- `People Also Viewed` usually shows other people from same company, we can use it to explore and add similar people.
- But when we reach the limit, Linkedin will blur the name and description, we can't click to that user's profile
- We can click the user's image, inspect the element, and find `alt="the_user_name"` then google search it.

### Search
- engineer manager at the_company hiring
- Explore `People Also Viewed`
- Check the user's connection
- in/the_user/detail/recent-activity/

### Add a note
- Add a note when we send an invitation, include why you want to add him/her: looking for a job and interested in your team, you experience etc.

### Use the free trial which allows you to send 5 InMail
