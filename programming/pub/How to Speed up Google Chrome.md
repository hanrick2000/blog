#### [Reader View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-view/ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh)
- it **reduces the memory usage a LOT** for pages that load a lot of flashes, ads.
- e.g. reduces this [page](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/should-i-log-out-my-mac-or-just-shut-down-3623615/){target="blank"} from around 450+ mb to 87mb.

  - The pros and crons, when to use it and the alternatives and other [must-have google chrome extensions](/2019/04/must-have-google-chrome-extensions.html ){target="blank"}

#### Tabs
- Kill tabs that uses a lot of memory at `More Tools -> Task Manager`, reload then if needed.
- **Kill tabs not needed more aggressively**
  - Install [Chrome Vimium](/2019/04/awesome-tips-about-chrome-vimium.html)
  - `cl` to close left tabs, `cr` to kill right tabs, `co` to kill other tabs
  - `count + x` to kill right x tabs
- Use `The Great Suspender` to suspend pages aggressively

##### Reuse Existing Tabs
- In Chrome search tabs, click `Switch to this tab`
  - Unfortunately this doesn't work with suspended tabs
- Use `Shift+t` the [Chrome Vimium Vomnibar](/2019/04/awesome-tips-about-chrome-vimium.html) to search and go to existing tabs instead open a new one
  - Works well with suspended tabs

#### Extensions
- Check memory used at `More Tools -> Task Manager`
- Uninstall extensions that are not used any more
- Temporarily disable  that uses occasionally
  - like ModHeader, Search Plus, Screenshot
- Change "Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites you visit:" to `On click` or `On specific sites`
- Kill the extensions that uses a lot of memory then reload them
  - Sometimes, Google Translate uses 600+ memory, just kill and reload it
