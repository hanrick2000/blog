### Gmail
<!-- - Easier to create calendar event -->
- Detect deadline in mail, offer to create event or remainder automatically
  - Privacy: default off, user can opt in

### Calendar
- Desktop notification only works when have calendar open in browser

### Google Drive
- Support "Fuzzy syntax search in the document"
  - searching "remove" in the doc can find delete etc

##### Voice Typing
- There is a bug in the language dropdown of the mic-palette widget.
- It doesn't scroll to the end of list, so hard to choose languages like `中文`, `日本语`
- We can reproduce it by moving the mic-palette to near the bottom.

<!-- ### Express
- Make sure one account per user
- 5% Credit card instead of coupon -->

### Blogger
- [store post.labels as it is(an array) in server side, not alphabetically](https://support.google.com/blogger/thread/6693810?hl=en)
  - So user can sort labels in a post as importance, may do recommendation based on importance of labels
<!-- - Support "search" in "All Labels" -->
  <!-- - button, divblog/ -->
- Support Markdown
  - even better: sync the markdown and the Compose (WYSIWYG editor), so we can use Grammarly to check the spell and syntax in the Compose.

#### Keep
- Add multiple places for reminder
  - It only support one address, it would be great to support multiple address as we go shopping to different stores even for same brand(like Costco)
- Voice typing doesn't support non-english (at least not Chinese)
