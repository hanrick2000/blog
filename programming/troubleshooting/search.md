#### organize folders
- separate your things
- Put your own things in a different folder
If you create some tools, chrome extensions, separate it from other software tools you download from internet

they are different, more useful,
so we can easy find them and backup them if needed

Don't mix different things, separate them

### Backup
backup config files ~/.bash* including history
