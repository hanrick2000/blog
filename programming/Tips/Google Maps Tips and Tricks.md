#### Search for Places on Your Route
It's very common we want to search a place between the source and the destination: for example, search the Spring Store between the home and work office.

- Add the destination in the Google Maps
- Click **Directions** and then add the source
- Click the add button, them move it into the middle of the source and destination
- Search your places, the first one is usually the most convenient one, in most cases, we can just click enter.

#### Offline Map
Occasionally, we need access Google Maps with no(or slow) mobile data connection(in the mountain or in another country).

Search in google map, then we can scroll, or zoom in or out the area to cover more area, then choose download.

n latest Android, we can also download offline map for a route.

By default, Google Maps download offline maps over wifi only. If needed, we can change to also download over mobile data: click the **Offline Map**, then click the cog shaped settings button in the top-right, then select "Over Wi-Fi or mobile network".

Till now, we can't use offline maps for walking directions:
- We can start the route when we are connected(in hotel, Starbucks, free wifi etc), then walking direction will continue to work even we have no connection later.
- Or try to use drive directions.
