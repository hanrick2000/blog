#### **Dark Mode**
- After enable dark mode in MacOS Mojave, It would be a little bit difficult to figure out which emails are new: not read yet.
- To fix this, we can change the email from default one to `dark` or `terminal` them at Settings -> Themes.

     Dark Mode             |  Terminal Mode

#### [Write Email Now And Send It Later](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/gmails-scheduling-tool-to-send-emails-later-keeps-you-from-being-an-enormous-jackass/)
- `Schedule Send`
- So we still have chances to cancel it or update it.
- So we can write it now (don't procrastinate) but send it at right time (not in the middle of night etc)
- It would be good if Google can make this feature even easier to use: like add one option (or make it configurable) to schedule to send it in 5 minutes.

#### [Create an event directly from Gmail](https://www.lifewire.com/create-a-google-calendar-event-from-a-message-in-gmail-1172093)
- Click 3dot icon then click "Create Event"
- to track deadline, follow up etc

#### Snooze Emails
- [Snooze emails until later](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010)
- We can find all snoozed emails at `Snoozed folder`

#### Draft Emails
- Create a draft email to save context: for example we receive one email we need handle and reply later, but no time to do now, we can create one draft email.
- We need type something to create a draft email. If we click reply then click cancel, it will not create a draft email as the content is empty.
- Clean old drafts: **in:draft older_than:4m**

---

#### Categories and Filters
- We can move emails to categories like **Promotions** or **Social** categories and teach Gmail to **Do this for future messages from this sender**.
- We cam create filters: has these specific words like **coupon** or **credit card +activate 0% +APR** then mark it as Important or categorize as Primary.
- Maintain these filters: when the filter doesn't apply any more, delete it.
 - For example, the store(like Google Express) once offered some coupon code we are interested, but they changed the practice or we you are not interested any more,, we can/should change it accordingly or just delete it.

#### Delete Emails
- delete all old emails older than 3 months in promotions: `category:promotions older_than:3m`
- Delete all emails that matches the query, not just the emails in first page:
  - Click the select all button, then if there are more emails than one page, it will show: `All 50 conversations on this page are selected.
Select all conversations that match this search`
  - Choose **Select all conversations that match this search**, then click delete button.
- **Filter message like this** to delete them.
  - it will filter message based on sender or `Has the words`
- **Unsubscribe** from email directly or change the notification in its service
- unwatch git repo if not interested
