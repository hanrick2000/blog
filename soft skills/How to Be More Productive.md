### What Problems to Solve
- is it worth?
- to what extent?
- Should we fix it now? or put it into backlog and solve it later?
  - Our brain will work on the problem in background, after we work on more same problem/domain, it may be much easier to solve it.
- what you try to achieve or learn

### Priority
- work on the most important thing
  - put trivial things into backlog

### Proactive

### Track + Notification
- Use Timer for wakeup
- Use Calendar to track event, deadline
- Use Keep to track ideas/todo

### Less Distraction
#### Turn off unnecessary notification
##### Gmail
- Gmail App only notifies email from primary category
- Figure our why it's marked as important and remove its filter or move it out from Primary category

<!-- Uninstall Apple News -->

### Schedule

#### Health
- sleep and wake up at the same time

#### Sleep & Rest
<!-- - better sleep/rest, so we can wake up -->
- [Do Not Disturb at Bedtime](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-ios-12-bedtime-feature/)
- unclutter your mind
- When fee tired, not in a good state, take a rest or go to sleep, otherwise may waste time to read news or watch TV.

#### Music
- to wake up
- get excited

#### Wake up
- My wife is a teacher, so she wakes up very early at 6:00 am
- It's best for me to adjust accordingly: wake up early.
