#### Make deliberate decision
- We make a lot of decision every day, some
we should try to make decision deliberately, explicitly, intentionally.

##### Ask some other's ideas/suggestions
- communication

#### Seek for more info needed to make better decision

### Info
#### Get correct info
- to find info, we can google search, but sometimes, to get the correct info, it's better to ask through the official channel: official forum, online chat or phone call.

#### Get info as early as possible

#### Get More info
- What, When, Where,
- the context, events above/below
- related



#### When we can get info from others
- Verify it, be skeptical, don't trust it without verifying or checking carefully.
- Same info may means different for different people, what it means to you.
