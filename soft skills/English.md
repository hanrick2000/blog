We are fixing this, but can you confirm if something was deployed/changed at your end around that time? We see a lot of GC and a spike in system stats starting at that time.

Seems things become better for select queries, but update queries are still busted.
Iâ€™m still seeing an elevated num requests per second. Is that expected?
