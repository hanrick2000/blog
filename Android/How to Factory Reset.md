As I will get a new phone from the new company, so there is no need to buy a new phone.
So I figure out that I can just use my old Nexus 6P phone for a few days.

go to recovery mode

click volume down then hold power button together
make sure the volume down button is really pressed, otherwise it will keep restarting

no command
