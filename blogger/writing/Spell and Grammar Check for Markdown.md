#### Spelling/Grammar Check
- There is no good (online) Markdown editor that we can do spelling/grammar check the preview (online), fix the preview and sync the change back to markdown source. (spelling/grammar check doesn't work well with markdown source, due to the extra syntax used by markdown.)

#### Atom
- Check text in [Atom](https://lifelongprogrammer.blogspot.com/2017/10/awesome-tips-about-atom-editor.html){target="blank"} when we are wiring in the [Atom Editor](https://lifelongprogrammer.blogspot.com/2017/10/awesome-tips-about-atom-editor.html){target="blank"}
  - Atom can detect some errors **Grammarly** can't: like mixed cases: ABle
  - `Cmd+Shift+;` to open the suggestion and fix the error.

#### [app.grammarly.com](https://app.grammarly.com){target="blank"}
- We can copy the markdown there and fix the spell and grammar error, but due to the extra syntax of markdown, Grammarly can't find some errors which it usually can.
- We can then copy the output (from [Markdown enhanced preview in Atom](https://lifelongprogrammer.blogspot.com/2019/03/must-have-atom-editor-packages.html){target="blank"}) there and find the error and fix them in the markdown source file.

#### [Grammarly Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen)
<!-- - [Also a standalone Mac App](https://app.grammarly.com/) -->
- Add `contenteditable="true"` to div(`div class="post-outer" in blogger`) to make Grammarly work anywhere.
<!-- - Use this together with Chrome's native spell checker -->
- Spell check on demand: Change "Site access" to "On Click"
